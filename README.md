# HTML_Page Maker - C#

With a simple .txt document, you can write and translate it into an HTML page! This project from my college was built with C#.


## How it works?

There are special characters you put in the text, and they generate specific tags according to what you want!

## Special characters

- To create a button: * *

- To create a ...: ! !
